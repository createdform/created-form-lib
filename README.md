This is the form component library for created form. 

created-form-lib folder is where the components live and a sample static `my-form.html`
can be found. This file is an example of how dynamic react components will be generated statically. 

Nextjs project is the view layer displaying how the components look and feel.

TBA: Storybook will be added next.
